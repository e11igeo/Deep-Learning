# Deep-Learning
## Deep Learning Course Assignments
This repository contains my assignments for the Deep Learning course as part of my Master's degree. The course covered a broad spectrum of topics within Deep Learning and Statistical Machine Learning, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical implementation.

## Assignments Overview

The course was structured to explore key concepts and techniques in deep learning through seven comprehensive assignments:

1. **Statistical Machine Learning and FFNN - Part I**: Focused on theoretical exercises related to statistical machine learning and the basics of feed-forward neural networks.

2. **Statistical Machine Learning and FFNN - Part II**: Implementing FFNNs from scratch and applying error back-propagation.

3. **Statistical Machine Learning and FFNN - Part III**: Introduction in PyTorch as a tool for more complex implementations of FFNNs, including hands-on error back-propagation exercises.

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**:CNN architectures, exploring their application in image recognition and processing tasks.

5. **Transformers and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: Examined advanced models for sequence data, focusing on RNNs and Transformers for tasks such as language modeling and text generation.

6. **Tricks of the Trade and Data Science with PyTorch**: Covered practical aspects of deep learning, including model optimization, regularization techniques, and deployment strategies.

7. **Variational Learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Explored the frontiers of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, implementing GANs and variational autoencoders to generate new data samples.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for all assignments, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data manipulation and visualization.
- **PyTorch** as the primary framework for designing and training neural network models.

## Final Project: Enhanced Car Part Segmentation with Deep Learning
Our project evaluated the effectiveness of U-Net and U-Net+ResNet models for car part segmentation, utilizing a comprehensive dataset provided by Deloitte Consulting. 

### Project Insights
